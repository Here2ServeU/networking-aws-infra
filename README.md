# T2S Services Networking Infrastructure

---

## Introduction
This project sets up a secure and scalable AWS networking infrastructure for T2S Services using Terraform. The infrastructure includes:

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** – The network foundation
- **Public and Private Subnets** – Logical network segmentation
- **NAT Gateway** – Internet access for private subnets
- **VPN Gateway** – Secure connectivity between on-prem and AWS
- **AWS Transit Gateway** – Centralized VPC communication
- **AWS Direct Connect** – High-speed, dedicated network link
- **Monitoring** – CloudWatch and Prometheus for real-time insights
- **Cost Monitoring** – **AWS Cost Explorer** for expense tracking
- **Security** – **AWS WAF, GuardDuty, and IAM** best practices
- **Reliability** – Auto Scaling and Multi-AZ deployments

With modular Terraform design, this infrastructure can be deployed across multiple environments (dev, stage, prod) efficiently.

## Terraform Setup and Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Terraform
Ensure Terraform is installed on your system.
```sh
terraform -v
```
If Terraform is not installed, follow the instructions at [Terraform Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

---

### Step 2: Create a Backend storage for the Terraform State File
- Navigate to the backend directory and run:
```sh
cd backend/
terraform init
```
- This initializes Terraform, downloads required providers, and configures the backend.

#### Plan the Infrastructure
- To preview changes before applying them:
```sh
terraform plan
```
This outputs the proposed changes.

#### Deploy the Infrastructure
- To deploy the infrastructure:
```sh
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
- This provisions all the resources you need for your Backend: S3 Bucket and DynamoDB table.

#### Verify Deployment
Once deployed, check the outputs:
```sh
terraform output
```

---

### Step 3: Deploy the Networking Infrastructure
- Navigate to the desired environment and configure the terraform.tfvars file as desired. 

#### Initialize the project.
```sh
cd environments/dev  #stage or prod as necessary. 
terraform init
```
- This initializes Terraform, downloads required providers, and configures the backend.

#### Plan the Infrastructure
- To preview changes before applying them:
```sh
terraform plan
```
This outputs the proposed changes.

#### Deploy the Infrastructure
- To deploy the infrastructure:
```sh
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
- This provisions all the networking resources in AWS.

#### Verify Deployment
Once deployed, check the outputs:
```sh
terraform output
```

---

### Step 4: Destroy the Infrastructure (If Needed)

#### Destroy the Backend infrastructure (whenever desired)
To remove all deployed resources:
```sh
cd backend
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

#### Destroy the Networking infrastructure (whenever desired)
To remove all deployed resources:
```sh
cd environments/dev  # or any other environments: stage, prod, etc.
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## Explanation of Each Resource

### Backend Remote for Terraform
**Purpose:**
- The Terraform backend remote stores and manages state files centrally, enabling collaboration, security, and consistency across infrastructure deployments.

**Use Case:**
- It allows multiple team members to work on the same infrastructure across different environments while preventing conflicts and ensuring state integrity using S3 and DynamoDB.


### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
**Purpose:**
- Acts as a virtual network to host AWS resources securely.

**Use Case:**
- Segregating environments (dev, stage, prod) into separate VPCs.

### Subnets (Public & Private)
**Purpose:**
- Public subnets allow internet access.
- Private subnets keep resources secure and isolated.

**Use Case:**
- Hosting web applications in public subnets while keeping databases in private subnets.

### NAT Gateway
**Purpose:**
- Allows outbound internet access for private subnet resources without exposing them.

**Use Case:**
- Letting backend servers in private subnets fetch updates from the internet.

### VPN Gateway
**Purpose:**
- Establishes a secure tunnel between AWS and on-premises environments.

**Use Case:**
- Connecting an on-premise data center to AWS for hybrid cloud deployment.

### AWS Transit Gateway
**Purpose:**
- Enables seamless communication between multiple VPCs and on-prem networks.

**Use Case:**
- Connecting multiple VPCs securely within an organization.

### AWS Direct Connect
**Purpose:**
- Provides a dedicated, high-speed network connection between AWS and on-premises networks.

**Use Case:**
- Improving performance for enterprise applications requiring high bandwidth and low latency.

### Monitoring
**Purpose:**
- Provides real-time logging, metrics, and alerts for network and application health.

**Use Case:**
- Using CloudWatch and Prometheus for log aggregation, anomaly detection, and performance insights.

### Cost Monitoring
**Purpose:**
- Tracks AWS spending and optimizes resource usage.

**Use Case:**
- AWS Cost Explorer to analyze expenses and enforce budgeting.

### Security
**Purpose:**
- Enhances security through AWS WAF, GuardDuty, and IAM best practices.

**Use Case:**
- Protecting against DDoS attacks, monitoring security threats, and enforcing role-based access control.

### Reliability
**Purpose:**
- Ensures system availability with auto-scaling and Multi-AZ deployments.

**Use Case:**
- Automatically scaling services to handle load and deploying across multiple availability zones for high availability.

## Real Case Scenarios

### Secure Web Application Deployment
**Scenario:** Hosting a web application where frontend servers are in public subnets, backend services in private subnets, and database services isolated.

**Solution:**
- Public subnets for ALB (Application Load Balancer) and web servers.
- Private subnets for backend services and databases.
- NAT Gateway for outbound access from private subnets.
- CloudWatch for performance monitoring.
- AWS WAF for web security.

### Hybrid Cloud Architecture
**Scenario:** A financial institution wants to extend its on-premises infrastructure into AWS securely.

**Solution:**
- AWS VPN Gateway to connect on-prem to AWS securely.
- Transit Gateway to manage multiple VPCs efficiently.
- Direct Connect for high-speed, low-latency communication.
- AWS GuardDuty for security monitoring.
- Cost Explorer to track expenses.

### Multi-VPC Communication for Microservices
**Scenario:** A company operates multiple microservices hosted in separate VPCs but requires secure, low-latency communication.

**Solution:**
- AWS Transit Gateway to establish a secure network hub.
- Private subnets in each VPC for isolation.
- Centralized routing via Transit Gateway to control access between services.
- Prometheus for microservices monitoring.

## Conclusion
This AWS networking infrastructure ensures scalability, security, and flexibility for T2S Services. Using Terraform, the infrastructure can be easily managed, versioned, and deployed across multiple environments. The combination of VPC, Subnets, NAT, VPN, Transit Gateway, Direct Connect, Monitoring, Cost Monitoring, Security, and Reliability makes it robust for hybrid cloud, multi-VPC architectures, and secure AWS networking.

For further improvements, consider integrating AWS Firewall, IAM best practices, and Reserved Instances for cost optimization.
